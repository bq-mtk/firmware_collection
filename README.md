# Supported devices
As of now, we only provide the original firmware for BQ devices that are powered by a MediaTek CPU. This includes the `M` series (MT6735 - MT8163) and the `E` (MT8392 - MT6592) series that the Spanish company launched during 2014 - 2016. Additional support can be provided if one of the developers gets a different device into their hands.

# Warnings
- We are **NOT** responsible for any loss of data, or the result of a device being hard-bricked. Firmwares are provided as-is and should work fine, however, if a bad flash is performed the device may become unusable or specific information such as MAC or S/N may be lost.
- The reason why these firmwares were re-uploaded is because as of 2019, the BQ website stopped working and, therefore, the firmwares that were hosted there were also lost, forever.

# Requirements
- The basic requirement is a Windows or Linux machine to be able to run the flashing program (SP Flash Tools).
- In some cases, **USB2** ports are recommended to use, USB3 ports may have issues with SP Flash Tools.
- If running under Windows 10 or higher, it's necessary to disable the driver signature n in order to install VCOM drivers.
